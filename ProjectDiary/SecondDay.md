# My Journey learning something hard to make
"Talent is cheaper than table salt. What separates the talented individual from the successful one is a lot of hard work."


Making a page builder is not an easy task, its a complex software with so much details involved, so to help me achive this task I had to break it down to smaller bits, so I can create a positive feedback loop by achieving small tasks.

## How drag and drop work?
This was my first thing I needed to understand, and here is what I learned about it today:

- You can make any element draggable by adding the "draggable attribute" to it, and making it true
- There are multiple event handlers for dragging and dropping, which are: onDrop, onDragOver, onDragEnter and onDragLeave

## Trying to undestand how wix work

Wix edits the page with iFrame, so each page you edit is loaded using iFrame tag, and you can drag and drop elements to the page as you want, so that will another intresting thing to work on.
