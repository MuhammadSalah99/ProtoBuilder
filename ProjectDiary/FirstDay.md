# Day One 

At first, I started working on the UI of the builder, based on Wix.com Edit your page service, I always find it fun copying styles or interfaces, your always learn a lot from.

## Using Tailwind for the first time.
It's my first time ever using Tailwind css, it has been a blast, using diffrent classes instead of pure css, I can custimize specific elements with no need writing each element its own class or use sudo classes and selectors in my style.css file.

## What I learnt:
- Using Tailwind to make a sidebar with a Drawer.
- Learnt to use Tailwind colors.
